CHAPTER 49
Behind the world – Ian’s plan  
Cedra could feel it, the intense pull between Aran and Evan, a silent battle of wills thickening the air around them. The shift in atmosphere was immediate, so much so that people around them, especially the women she had been sitting with, were now watching intently, their hushed whispers fueling the drama that was quickly unfolding. 
"Two men fighting over her… how thrilling!"
"Who will win her favor?"
"A masked mystery versus a golden prince? Oh, what a story!"
Cedra sighed internally, already anticipating where this was going. Evan was the first to break the ice, his smooth, velvet voice laced with amusement.
"A hooded stranger stealing away my dance partner? How terribly rude of you, don’t you think?"
Aran’s response was immediate, sharp, cold, final.
"Not my problem. She’s my partner."
Evan merely laughed, as if Aran’s stiff, no-nonsense demeanor amused him to no end. He tilted his head, his eyes glinting with interest as he turned his attention back to Cedra.
"Tell me, is he a bodyguard or a lover?" 
His voice dipped into something playful, teasing. 
"You know, for you, I wouldn’t mind sharing… for now. But I must warn you, my dear, I can be quite possessive. Especially when it comes to my woman."
Aran’s body tensed immediately. His grip on Cedra tightened ever so slightly before he moved her behind him, his stance shifting into something far more aggressive. He stepped directly into Evan’s space, their faces inches apart, an unspoken challenge crackling between them.
"I don’t like your attitude. Find yourself someone else."
Evan, however, did not waver. He mirrored Aran’s intensity, a wolfish smirk dancing on his lips.
"Hmm… no, I don’t think I will," he mused, voice light yet dripping with provocation. 
"So tell me, what will you do about it?"
Aran’s emerald eyes darkened, but instead of reacting violently, he gave Evan an infuriatingly slow smirk, one that carried a dangerous edge.
"She’s not interested."
Evan exhaled through his nose, amused, but not deterred. He leaned slightly to the side, peering past Aran to meet Cedra’s gaze, his expression a mix of confidence and intrigue.
"But I am." 
His lips curled upward. 
"Don’t you think a beauty like her deserves someone who matches her? Someone who stands beside her instead of hiding in the shadows?"
His blue gaze flicked pointedly to Aran’s hood, the implication clear.
"If you want me to back down." 
Evan continued smoothly. 
"Why don’t you remove it? Let me see if you are worthy to stand by her side."
Aran’s jaw tightened, but his resolve did not falter.
"It’s not your decision to make."
Evan tilted his head, the amusement in his gaze deepening.
"Ah, but it is. You see, I get to decide whether I will fight for her, steal her away, or simply let it go."
His words were laced with arrogance, with power. Aran had enough. Without another word, he turned, intent on pulling Cedra away from the heated standoff and back to the inn, only to realize. She was gone. His entire body stiffened, his head snapping around in immediate alertness. Evan chuckled, a low, rich sound.
"Oh dear, I think she’s grown tired of us both."
And just like that, both men found themselves scanning the crowd, searching desperately for any sign of Cedra. Yet, no one had noticed her leave. No one had seen where she went. Because everyone had been too focused on them.
Ian’s grip was firm but not forceful, his pace calculated, guiding Cedra through the crowded streets with practiced ease. The vibrant energy of the festival faded into a muffled hum as he led her through a series of narrow alleys, away from the prying eyes of curious onlookers. When he finally released her hand, they were deep within the shadows, hidden away from the city's festive glow.
"You looked like someone in need of a savior." 
Ian’s voice was smooth, edged with subtle amusement. Cedra turned to face him, eyes narrowing as she took in his impeccable appearance. His dark hair was slicked back, a departure from its usual tousled look. Underneath his cloak, he wore a well-tailored suit, exuding an air of formality and effortless power. Even in the dim alleyway, his piercing blue eyes glowed, cutting through the darkness like shards of ice.
"I prayed to every god and creature in existence for help," Cedra quipped, arms crossing. 
"But I didn’t expect it to be you. What are you doing in Miewa?"
Ian leaned casually against the cold stone wall, arms crossed over his chest, his demeanor entirely unbothered.
"Do you think just because I’m the president of The Whispering Trade, I remain locked in an office all day?" he mused, one brow arched in mock offense. 
"I’m here for a client. Information retrieval, as always."
Cedra scoffed, a confused smile tugging at her lips.
"Uhm, yes? You don’t exactly strike me as the type to do the dirty work yourself."
Ian’s expression shifted, his smile darkened, his eyes gleamed with something unreadable. He let out a quiet laugh, one that sent a cold shiver down her spine.
"Perfect," he murmured, his voice dangerously smooth. 
"I've been contemplating a problem for a while now, unsure of the solution. And then, how fortunate, you appear, the final missing piece to my puzzle."
His tone was low, manipulative, intoxicating. Cedra’s instincts flared.
"Ian, no. Whatever you’re scheming, count me out." 
She shook her head. 
"Just take me back to the square, I’d rather deal with Aran and Evan’s posturing than owe you anything."
She turned to leave. And then.
"This is not something that benefits only me, but also you, Cédric."
Her entire body froze. The moment his lips curled around that name, darkness surged from within her like a violent storm. Shadows whipped around Ian’s feet, crawling up his body in tangible tendrils, solidifying into an unyielding force. Netherkin had awoken. Ian let out a strained groan as the darkness tightened around him, constricting like a living vice. He didn’t thrash, didn’t fight it, but she could see the tension in his jaw, the subtle wince of pain despite his best attempts to conceal it. Cedra turned slowly, her expression now shrouded in cold fury. The dark entity coiled around her like a second skin, forming a shadowed mask over her forehead and eyes. Beneath her fingertips, golden light pulsed, Rays' power reacting to the shift in her emotions.
"Where did you hear that name?" 
Her voice was deeper, tinged with a lethal warning. Ian chuckled weakly, but before he could answer, Netherkin squeezed harder, stealing the air from his lungs. With a flick of her wrist, she slammed him into the wall, the impact reverberating through the alley. The force sent him crashing onto the cold ground. Before he could regain his footing, Cedra was on him, her fingers curling around his throat, lifting him with inhuman strength. For the first time, Ian’s gaze flickered, not with fear, but with something even more dangerous. Intrigue. Fascination. A challenge. Even now, trapped beneath her power, he managed to smirk.
"If you want answers, darling, you should at least let me breathe."
Her grip tightened. Then, with a scoff, she released him, letting him drop unceremoniously onto the cobblestones. Ian exhaled sharply, adjusting his coat with an air of calm nonchalance, as if he hadn’t just been manhandled by a shadow entity.
"You’re surprisingly aggressive, Cedra. No wonder you’re not exactly popular with men." 
His smirk widened as he brushed dust from his sleeves. She glared.
"If I were your enemy, you’d know by now," he added smoothly, his voice laced with mock sincerity. 
"So, what do you say? Let’s talk. Let’s make a deal. But not here."
Cedra’s breath was still uneven, her mind spinning. 
Damn him. 
He was right. He had only ever helped her, never directly acted against her. She withdrew her power, the shadows retreating back into her core. Ian exhaled, running a hand through his hair before offering it out to her. She hesitated.
"You should hold onto me. You wouldn’t want to get lost in the festival crowds, now would you?"
His voice was teasing, yet there was something serious in his gaze. After a long pause, Cedra begrudgingly placed her hand in his. Ian’s fingers curled gently but firmly around hers as he began leading her through the labyrinth of streets, toward The Whispering Trade's hidden base in Rachdale. He led her into a narrow side street, where an old bookstore stood, nestled at the city's edge. The shop had an air of forgotten history, its sign rusted and weathered, swaying slightly in the breeze. The door creaked as they pushed it open, revealing a dimly lit space cluttered with books, not neatly arranged on shelves, but stacked in chaotic piles, forming small mountains on the floor. Dust coated everything, as though time had abandoned this place long ago. An elderly man sat behind a wooden counter, barely acknowledging their presence with a slow nod as Ian strode past him. Cedra followed, her eyes scanning the neglected tomes, their spines cracked and pages yellowed. Ian led her through a door at the back of the shop, revealing what seemed to be a storage area filled with even more books. He approached one of the shelves, indistinguishable from the others, and with a calculated movement, pulled a book. With a soft click, the entire shelf shifted, revealing a hidden spiral staircase descending into darkness. Cedra hesitated for a brief moment before stepping after Ian, her boots echoing against the stone steps as they ventured downward. The stairs led to a long corridor, damp and dimly lit, the scent of aged parchment and faint mildew lingering in the air. At the end of the passage, a heavy door stood waiting. Ian did not pause, he grasped the handle and pushed it open. The sight that met them was nothing like she had expected. The room beyond was breathtaking, dark yet vibrant, filled with a rich, almost intoxicating ambiance. Towering bookshelves lined the walls, stretching up toward a high, arched ceiling adorned with intricate carvings. Massive stained-glass windows cast an ethereal glow of blues, purples, and greens, their shimmering light shifting with the flicker of dozens of candles placed throughout the space. The scent of old leather and burning wax intertwined, creating an atmosphere both warm and mysterious. A luxurious set of furniture occupied the center of the room, a deep burgundy velvet sofa with dark, ornate carvings, surrounded by plush armchairs and an elegant coffee table with a reflective, almost enchanted surface. A thick, embroidered rug spread across the floor, its intricate patterns catching the glow from the flickering candlelight. Everything about this place felt secretive, as if it had been designed for clandestine meetings and whispered truths. Ian moved with ease, shrugging off his coat and taking a seat on the velvet sofa, draping one arm casually over the backrest. His crystalline blue eyes gleamed in the dim light, the angles of his sharp features highlighted by the stained-glass reflections. Cedra remained standing for a moment, still taking in the sheer magnificence of the hidden space.
“Impressive, isn’t it?” 
Ian’s voice broke the silence, smooth and edged with amusement. 
“A sanctuary away from prying eyes.”
Cedra exhaled softly and finally took a seat beside him, though her body remained tense. 
"So, let me hear it." she said, her gaze sharp and unyielding. 
There was a guardedness in her posture, a clear unwillingness to let down her walls. Ian leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his fingers laced together as he studied her.
"Let me start by telling you about my problem," he began, his tone calm, yet laced with a simmering edge of resentment. 
"For months now, I’ve had an irritating thorn in my side. No matter how many times I remove it, reject it, it keeps coming back. So, I decided to investigate. Why the desperation to have me? And I found out that the damned man’s first plan failed, or rather, disappointed him."
His jaw tightened, a flicker of something dark flashing in his crystal-blue eyes before he continued.
"He wants to use me for his passion and his ideals, but to do that, he needs a strong foundation, a piece to lead and control his forces, an image to rally behind, a beacon of hope for his men. The ideal figure. The perfect man." 
Ian exhaled, a smirk playing on his lips.
"Me."
The word hung in the air, dripping with self-assurance. His voice turned mocking, disdainful.
"Of course, I am perfect. Flawless. He wants to exploit me, to wield my presence as a weapon to fortify his power, to refine his image, to use me to sway the masses." 
His fingers tightened against each other. 
"And trust me, I have no intention of allowing myself to be reduced to a mere tool in his arsenal. I despise him. The very thought of him makes my blood boil. His death would bring me joy."
Ian leaned back slightly, tilting his head with a cruel amusement.
"What is a more fitting revenge than to manipulate him? Let him think he has it all under control, let him believe he is shaping the perfect narrative, when in reality, I am dismantling everything from the inside. Piece by piece. Until, before he even realizes it, it all crumbles beneath him. Every ounce of effort, every calculated move, wasted. And the best part?" 
His smirk widened. 
"A knife in the back from the one person he should trust the most."
His voice was smooth, intoxicating in its confidence, but there was an undeniable madness beneath it. The kind of madness born from deep, festering hatred. He wasn’t just angry, he was consumed by it. Cedra studied him, wary.
"Alright," she said cautiously. 
"And where exactly do I fit into all of this? More importantly, how do you know my name?"
Ian’s gaze sharpened, assessing her.
"You really don’t remember me, do you?" he mused, almost entertained by the realization. 
"But that doesn’t matter. I know who you are. You are the Crown Prince’s younger brother. And your death—" his smirk faltered, turning into something colder. 
"—was staged by him as well."
Cedra’s breath caught in her throat, but Ian continued, unbothered by the weight of his words.
"You’ve been living your life in hiding, tucked away in a quiet village in Windfield. And now, you’re likely hunting for Hastings’ son, the same man who helped Wellington, my father, seize power."
He let the statement settle, watching as the pieces began to shift in Cedra’s mind. Cedra was shaken by the revelation, especially that Ian was Wellington’s son, but she refused to show shock, only revulsion and anger. She cast him a look, one filled with nothing but hatred. Every thought, every feeling, every sliver of trust she had harbored for Ian vanished in that instant. Only fury remained in her eyes.
"So, you’re that bastard’s son? Ha, what a small world," she sneered, her voice dripping with mockery. She scoffed, shaking her head. 
"I have no reason to help you. Honestly, I’d rather be anywhere else right now."
She pushed herself up to leave, the last bit of regard she had for Ian now dust beneath her heels. Ian watched her in silence, his cold smile unwavering, his piercing blue eyes analyzing her like she was nothing more than a puzzle he was piecing together. Then, he smirked and leaned back into the couch.
"Sweetheart, you won’t find him without our help," he taunted.
Cedra turned, her eyes burning with unfiltered disdain.
"Ian Wellington," she said his name as if it was something vile on her tongue. 
"I want nothing to do with you. I don’t care how you found out who I am, I don’t care what information you have on Hastings. I will find out on my own. Let’s just hope our paths never cross again."
Ian chuckled, a slow, almost melodious laugh, yet beneath it lurked something wrong, something cruel.
"You should learn to swallow your pride and choose your enemies wisely, Cedra," he mocked. 
His tone was smooth, but there was an edge beneath it, a test, a challenge. 
"I knew you were impulsive, but I didn’t realize emotions had taken over your intelligence as well."
Cedra’s gaze darkened. Her lips curled, venom lacing every word.
"You and your dear father are so alike," she sneered. 
"You both have the same disgusting personality."
The smirk on Ian’s face vanished. His jaw clenched, brows furrowed as anger rippled through him. He let out a sharp exhale, clearly restraining himself.
"I could very well be your death, Cedra," he warned, his voice low, seething. 
"My father would love to get his hands on you. Tell me, do you have so much pride that you’ve lost the natural instinct of fear?"
She tilted her head, smirking at him with mock amusement.
"Let him come," she whispered. 
"I could kill you right now, Ian, but for everything you’ve done, you have my mercy. I don’t expect you to be foolish enough to waste it."
She stepped toward him, meeting his cold glare with a wicked smile.
"You would never bow to Wellington," she whispered, taunting. 
"Come on, Ian. I expected a better threat from you."
Then, her voice dropped lower, her words cutting like steel.
"If he comes for me, then trust me, even if it costs my life, I’ll make sure he gets a fight. But I have no interest in the throne. Our conflict only becomes reality if you decide to reveal me."
Ian took a step closer, his presence looming, their gazes locked in a silent battle.
"Aren’t you being a little short-sighted?" he mused, voice smooth, almost entertained. 
"I know you’re not as good a person as you pretend to be. I know your hatred, Cedra. Even if you don’t want the throne, is it really okay for Wellington to continue ruling without consequence? His hands are drenched in your family’s blood. Do you not seethe at the thought of his smug smile as they begged for mercy?"
Cedra’s jaw tightened. Her expression was firm, unyielding.
"Nothing will bring them back, Ian! His head will accomplish nothing!"
Ian merely smirked, leaning in slightly.
"But what about you?" he whispered, his voice rich with persuasion. 
"Wouldn’t his head in your hands bring you peace? Would it soothe your nightmares? Your pain? Would all that darkness in you finally vanish?"
His gaze sharpened, a predator studying its prey.
"You should be more selfish, Cedra," he murmured, his voice like silk wrapping around steel.
"Because, in the end… you only have yourself."
Cedra’s hands clenched into fists. Her lips pressed into a thin line. She refused to meet his gaze. Ian didn’t let up.
"Let me make it happen," he continued, his voice dropping to a near-whisper, dangerous yet enticing.
"Let me give you his head. Let me deliver justice. And in return, I get my revenge. You can use me as much as I use you. Whatever you want, I can make it happen."
Cedra inhaled sharply, her voice barely above a whisper.
"Ian… that doesn’t solve anything. More blood… is not what this world needs."
Ian let out a low, amused chuckle.
"A bloodbath that would prevent thousands more, Cedra." 
His expression darkened. 
"Nothing in this world is fair. There are no heroes coming to save you. There is no justice, not unless you make it happen."
He tilted his head, watching her with quiet satisfaction as hesitation flickered in her eyes.
"You know Wellington wants war. He wants every kingdom under his control. You know what that means, he needs soldiers, bodies to throw into battle. Your people. The people of Jalstan and Miewa. The death toll among humans will be unimaginable."
His voice turned sharper.
"And let’s be realistic, shall we?" 
He scoffed. 
"It’s not just humans who will die. The other races will be slaughtered just as easily. An incalculable number of corpses. But we, you and I, can stop that. Maybe even prevent it entirely."
Cedra hesitated. What Ian was saying… it was true. But she didn’t want it to be. She didn’t want vengeance. She just wanted to live. But at the same time… She didn’t want Wellington on the throne. She didn’t want war. Ian stepped even closer, his presence overwhelming, suffocating. His crystal-blue eyes locked onto hers, unreadable yet brimming with something dangerous, something she couldn’t quite place. With a slow, deliberate motion, he reached out, lifting her chin with the tip of his finger. The touch was light, almost teasing, yet it commanded her full attention.
"So, let’s talk, Cedra," he murmured, his voice dipping into something velvety and smooth, laced with just enough danger to send a shiver down her spine. 
"Let’s find a deal that benefits both of us. A simple conversation… surely that can’t hurt too much?"
His smirk deepened, knowing, as if he had already won.
